## 1. Prerequisites
### 1.1 **Ubuntu** and **ROS**
**Ubuntu >= 16.04**

For **Ubuntu 18.04 or higher**, the **default** PCL and Eigen is enough for FAST-LIO to work normally.

ROS    >= Melodic. [ROS Installation](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Installation)

### 1.2. **PCL && Eigen**
PCL    >= 1.8,   Follow [PCL Installation](http://www.pointclouds.org/downloads/linux.html).

Eigen  >= 3.3.4, Follow [Eigen Installation](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page).

### 1.3. **glog && gflags**
```shell
sudo apt-get install libgoogle-glog-dev libgflags-dev
```  


## 2. Build
Clone the repository and catkin_make:

```bash
    cd ~/$A_ROS_DIR$/src
    git clone https://github.com/hku-mars/FAST_LIO.git
    cd FAST_LIO
    git submodule update --init
    cd ../..
    catkin_make
    source devel/setup.bash
```
- 将livox msg转移到代码中,不在需要安装livox相关驱动,catkin_make过程可能报错缺失fast_lio/Custom***,再次执行catkin_make可解决
- If you want to use a custom build of PCL, add the following line to ~/.bashrc
```export PCL_ROOT={CUSTOM_PCL_PATH}```
## 3. Directly run
Noted:

A. Please make sure the IMU and LiDAR are **Synchronized**, that's important.

B. The warning message "Failed to find match for field 'time'." means the timestamps of each LiDAR points are missed in the rosbag file. That is important for the forward propagation and backwark propagation.

C. We recommend to set the **extrinsic_est_en** to false if the extrinsic is give. As for the extrinsic initiallization, please refer to our recent work: [**Robust Real-time LiDAR-inertial Initialization**](https://github.com/hku-mars/LiDAR_IMU_Init).

### 3.1 For Avia
Connect to your PC to Livox Avia LiDAR by following  [Livox-ros-driver installation](https://github.com/Livox-SDK/livox_ros_driver), then
```
    cd ~/$FAST_LIO_ROS_DIR$
    source devel/setup.bash
    roslaunch fast_lio mapping_avia.launch
    roslaunch livox_ros_driver livox_lidar_msg.launch
```
- For livox serials, FAST-LIO only support the data collected by the ``` livox_lidar_msg.launch ``` since only its ``` livox_ros_driver/CustomMsg ``` data structure produces the timestamp of each LiDAR point which is very important for the motion undistortion. ``` livox_lidar.launch ``` can not produce it right now.
- If you want to change the frame rate, please modify the **publish_freq** parameter in the [livox_lidar_msg.launch](https://github.com/Livox-SDK/livox_ros_driver/blob/master/livox_ros_driver/launch/livox_lidar_msg.launch) of [Livox-ros-driver](https://github.com/Livox-SDK/livox_ros_driver) before make the livox_ros_driver pakage.

### 3.2 For Livox serials with external IMU

mapping_avia.launch theratically supports mid-70, mid-40 or other livox serial LiDAR, but need to setup some parameters befor run:

Edit ``` config/avia.yaml ``` to set the below parameters:

1. LiDAR point cloud topic name: ``` lid_topic ```
2. IMU topic name: ``` imu_topic ```
3. Translational extrinsic: ``` extrinsic_T ```
4. Rotational extrinsic: ``` extrinsic_R ``` (only support rotation matrix)
- The extrinsic parameters in FAST-LIO is defined as the LiDAR's pose (position and rotation matrix) in IMU body frame (i.e. the IMU is the base frame). They can be found in the official manual.
- FAST-LIO produces a very simple software time sync for livox LiDAR, set parameter ```time_sync_en``` to ture to turn on. But turn on **ONLY IF external time synchronization is really not possible**, since the software time sync cannot make sure accuracy.

### 3.3 For Velodyne or Ouster (Velodyne as an example)

Step A: Setup before run

Edit ``` config/velodyne.yaml ``` to set the below parameters:

1. LiDAR point cloud topic name: ``` lid_topic ```
2. IMU topic name: ``` imu_topic ``` (both internal and external, 6-aixes or 9-axies are fine)
3. Set the parameter ```timestamp_unit``` based on the unit of **time** (Velodyne) or **t** (Ouster) field in PoindCloud2 rostopic
4. Line number (we tested 16, 32 and 64 line, but not tested 128 or above): ``` scan_line ```
5. Translational extrinsic: ``` extrinsic_T ```
6. Rotational extrinsic: ``` extrinsic_R ``` (only support rotation matrix)
- The extrinsic parameters in FAST-LIO is defined as the LiDAR's pose (position and rotation matrix) in IMU body frame (i.e. the IMU is the base frame).

Step B: Run below
```
    cd ~/$FAST_LIO_ROS_DIR$
    source devel/setup.bash
    roslaunch fast_lio mapping_velodyne.launch
```

Step C: Run LiDAR's ros driver or play rosbag.

### 3.4 PCD file save

Set ``` pcd_save_enable ``` in launchfile to ``` 1 ```. All the scans (in global frame) will be accumulated and saved to the file ``` FAST_LIO/PCD/scans.pcd ``` after the FAST-LIO is terminated. ```pcl_viewer scans.pcd``` can visualize the point clouds.

*Tips for pcl_viewer:*
- change what to visualize/color by pressing keyboard 1,2,3,4,5 when pcl_viewer is running. 
```
    1 is all random
    2 is X values
    3 is Y values
    4 is Z values
    5 is intensity
```

## 4. Rosbag Example
### 4.1 Livox Avia Rosbag

Files: Can be downloaded from [google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YL5MQVYgAM8oAWUm7e3OGXZBPKkanmY1?usp=sharing)

Run:
```bash
roslaunch fast_lio mapping_avia_lio.launch
rosbag play YOUR_DOWNLOADED.bag

```

### 4.2 Velodyne HDL-32E Rosbag

**NCLT Dataset**: Original bin file can be found [here](http://robots.engin.umich.edu/nclt/).

We produce [Rosbag Files](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VBK5idI1oyW0GC_I_Hxh63aqam3nocNK?usp=sharing) and [a python script](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1leh7DxbHx29DyS1NJkvEfeNJoccxH7XM/view) to generate Rosbag files: ```python3 sensordata_to_rosbag_fastlio.py bin_file_dir bag_name.bag```
    
Run:
```bash
roslaunch fast_lio mapping_velodyne_lio.launch ## velodyne-->robosense
rosbag play YOUR_DOWNLOADED.bag
```

## 5. Todo List
[ ] offline rosbag mapping  
[ ] add slam pose graph (loop detection)
